<p>My wife is the kind of person whose footsteps leave bright marks wherever she goes. From the moment 
  I met her as a paralegal in the Army, she has excelled in every course, assignment, and responsibility placed in her path, 
  rising to the top of every military school she attended and outperforming even members of rival branches. She built a rare 
  academic mountain as well, earning an industry-standard HR certification and four graduate degrees: a Master of Arts from 
  Webster University, a Master of Operational Arts and Science from the U.S. Air Command and Staff College where she was 
  recognized as the top Distinguished Honor Graduate, a Master of Arts in Criminal Justice and Victimology from Seattle 
  University, and a Juris Doctor from the University of New Hampshire. She retired as a field-grade officer from the United 
  States Army with more medals and accolades than can fit in a single line of text, and today serves North Carolina as an 
  attorney who continues to exceed expectations with quiet precision. Yet beyond the ranks, degrees, and honors, she is the 
  devoted wife, caring sister, and revered daughter whose steadiness anchors me and whose character shapes every room shes 
  in. This first webpage is dedicated to her, because she is the foundation of everything I build.</p>
